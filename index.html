                <p class="ans">
                    <b>A:</b> All Stars are placed in a cohort of 20 boys at a real tech company in Manhattan. This
                    year we
                    are happy to announce that All Star Code will also serve the students of Pittsburgh, and will
                    partner
                    with a tech company there to host our first cohort outside of NYC. Our past host sites include
                    Microsoft,
                    Google, and Goldman Sachs. You’ll also get to venture outside of the office, with site visits to
                    other
                    companies, guest speakers, and fun team-building activities with other cohorts of All Stars.</p>

                <p class="ans">
                    <b>A:</b> Yes. It’s totally free, including transportation and meals during the program. Students
                    will
                    be given a free Metrocard (New York City), PATH card (New Jersery), or ConnectCard (Pittsburgh) for

                    <b>A:</b> No. Our All Stars shine in all sorts of ways, and grades are just one way to shine. GPA
                    is NOT used in our selection process. We do collect GPA data for our statistics.</p>

                    start. Please send inquiries to <a href='mailto:admissions@allstarcode.org'>ASC Admissions</a>, if

                    Intensive?</summary>
                <p class="ans">
                    <b>A:</b> Our program is specifically designed for rising juniors and seniors in high school. We’d
                    love
                    to see you at non-SI events throughout the year and welcome your application when you are old
                    enough!</p>

                <p class="ans">
                    <b>A:</b> Once the application closes in March, there will be a selection period. All students who
                    are accepted
                    into the program will receive notifications by the end of April.</p>

                <p class="ans">
                    <b>A:</b> Absolutely. Many students will qualify for the program but will not be selected in the
                    first round.
                    They will receive notification of the opportunity to join a waiting list, and will be invited to
                    join
                    as spots become available.</p>

                    <b>Q:</b> You say that preference is given to Black and Latino students. I'm not Black or Latino;
                    does thsummaryt
                    mean I'm not eligible?</summary>
                <p class="ans">
                    <b>A:</b> Less than 1% of VC-backed startups has a Black or Latino founder on the team, and our
                    programming
                    is designed to inspire All Stars to change that. We want to give priority to the students most
                    directly
                    affected by this stark opportunity gap, who in this case, self-identify as Black and/or Latino. We
                    have
                    always welcomed students of other identities in our program, so we encourage you to apply, but
                    priority
                    will be given to qualified Black and/or Latino students.</p>
