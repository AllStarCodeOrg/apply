                        Traditionally, students are placed in a class of 20 students at locations across New York City, Jersey City, or Pittsburgh. These host sites are provided by our program partners and have included Google, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase, Medidata, Major League Baseball, Carnegie Mellon University, and many others. Although the 2020 and 2021 Summer Intensive have shifted to a virtual model, our students will still have the opportunity to interact with their host site through unique workshops, mentorship sessions, and more! <!-- <span class="important">All Star Code Headquarters will NOT serve as a host!</span> -->
